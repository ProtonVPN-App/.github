## About ProtonVPN
ProtonVPN represents a comprehensive approach to online privacy and security, built upon the same principles of transparency and trust that established its sibling service Proton Mail as a leader in secure communication. Unlike conventional VPN services that prioritize convenience over security, ProtonVPN is engineered with privacy as its foundational principle, incorporating technical safeguards that protect user data from both external threats and internal access. The service operates under Swiss privacy laws, which are among the strongest in the world, and maintains a strict no-logs policy that has been independently verified, ensuring that user activity remains private even from the service provider itself.

The platform distinguishes itself through its integrated approach to privacy protection that extends beyond basic encryption to include features like Secure Core architecture, which routes traffic through privacy-friendly countries before reaching its final destination, providing additional protection against network-based attacks. The VPN Accelerator technology addresses common performance limitations of encrypted connections, making strong privacy protection practical for everyday internet use including streaming and large file transfers. ProtonVPN's commitment to transparency includes open-source client applications that allow security experts to verify the implementation, and regular publication of transparency reports that detail government data requests. This combination of technical sophistication, legal protection, and organizational transparency makes ProtonVPN particularly valuable for journalists protecting sources, activists in repressive regions, business professionals handling sensitive information, privacy-conscious individuals, and anyone seeking to maintain digital autonomy in an increasingly monitored online environment.
